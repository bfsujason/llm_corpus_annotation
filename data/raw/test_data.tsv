北风如刀，满地冰霜。	
江南近海滨的一条大路上，一队清兵手执刀枪，押着七辆囚车，冲风冒寒，向北而行。	Along a coastal road somewhere south of the Yangtze River, a detachment of soldiers, each of them armed with a halberd, was escorting a line of seven prison carts, trudging northwards in the teeth of a bitter wind.
前面三辆囚车中分别监禁的是三个男子，都作书生打扮，一个是白发老者，两个是中年人。	In each of the first three carts a single male prisoner was caged, identifiable by his dress as a member of the scholar class. One was a white-haired old man. The other two were men of middle years.
后面四辆囚车中坐的是女子，最后一辆囚车中是个少妇，怀中抱着个女婴。	The four rear carts were occupied by women, the last of them by a young mother holding a baby girl at her breast.
女婴啼哭不休。 她母亲温言相呵，女婴只是大哭。	The little girl was crying in a continuous wail which her mother's gentle words of comfort were powerless to console.
囚车旁一清兵恼了，伸腿在车上踢了一脚，喝道：“再哭，再哭！	One of the soldiers marching alongside, irritated by the baby's crying, aimed a mighty kick at the cart. 'Stop it! Shut up!
老子踢死你！”	Or I'll really give you something to cry about!'
那女婴一惊，哭得更加响了。	The baby, startled by this sudden violence, cried even louder.
离开道路数十丈处有座大屋，屋檐下站着一个中年文士，一个十一二岁的小孩。	Under the eaves of a large house, some hundred yards from the road, a middle-aged scholar was standing with a ten- or eleven-year-old boy at his side.
那文士见到这等情景，不禁长叹一声，眼眶也红了，说道：“可怜，可怜！”	He was evidently affected by this little scene, for a groan escaped his lips and he appeared to be very close to tears. 'Poor creatures!' he murmured to himself.
那小孩问道：“爹爹，他们犯了什么罪？”	'Papa,' said the little boy, 'what have they done wrong?'
