钱老板道：“是，是，多谢香主。” 在一张椅上坐了，续道：“属下将小郡主藏在猪肚里带进宫来，一来是为瞒过宫门侍卫的重重搜检，二来是要瞒过沐王府众人的耳目。	'Thank you, Master,' said Butcher Qian, seating himself in one of the chairs and continuing. 'There were really two reasons why I hid the Little Countessinside this pig's carcass. One was to get her past the Palace Guard: they always search everyone at the gate. But it was also to get her past any of the Mu Family spies who might be out watching for us.
他奶奶的，沐公爷手下，只怕真有几个厉害人物，不可不防。	There are some really dangerous people among that Mu lot, you can't afford to take any chances.
小郡主若不是藏在宫里，难保不给他们抢了回去。”	If she's hidden anywhere other than in the Palace, there's no guaranteeing they wouldn't try to get her back.'
韦小宝道：“你说要将小郡主藏在宫里？”	'So you're proposing to hide her in the Palace?' said Trinket.
钱老板道：“属下可不敢这么说，一切全凭韦香主作主。	'Well, that's not really for me to say,' said the butcher. 'It's entirely up to you, Master.
藏在宫里，当然是普天下最稳妥的所在。	Mind you, look anywhere you like, you'll never find a safer place than this.
沐王府的高手再多，总敌不过大内侍卫。	However many of their ace fighters the Mu Family may have got in the city, they're not going to take on the Palace Guard.
小郡主竟会在皇宫之中，别说他们决计想不到，查不出，就算知道了，又怎有能耐冲进皇宫来救人？	Not that they'd ever guess she was in the Palace, anyway. But even suppose—it's very unlikely, but just suppose—they did find out she was here, they'd never try getting in here to rescue her.
他们如能进宫来将小郡主救出去，那么连鞑子皇帝也能绑架去了。 天下决没这个道理。	If they could get in to do that, they could just as well get in to carry off the Tartar Emperor, and they've never tried to do that yet because they know it's out of the question.
不过属下胆大妄为，事先没向韦香主请示，擅自将小郡主带进宫来，给韦香主增添不少危险，不少麻烦，实在该死之极。”	Of course, it was rather a nerve, taking it on myself to bring the Little Countess in here without consulting you. It means a lot of danger for you, Master. And trouble. I deserve to be hung.'
韦小宝心道：“你将人带都带进来了，自己说该死，却也没死。	'You say yourself that you deserve to be hung,' thought Trinket, 'but you know damn well that you won't be.
把小郡主藏在宫里，果然是好计，沐王府的人一来想不到，二来救不出。	Still, it does seem the best plan to hide her in here. As he says, it's the one place they will never think of looking; and they'd never be able to get her out of here, even if they did.
你胆大妄为，难道我胆子就小了？”	Well, Mister Butcher Qian, if you had the nerve to kidnap her and smuggle her into the Palace, I suppose I ought to have the nerve to keep her here.'
笑道：“你这计策很好，我将小郡主藏在这里好了。”	He gave the man a smile. 'It's a very good idea,' he said. 'We'll hide her here then.'
钱老板道：“是，是，韦香主说这件事行得，那定然行得。	'If you think it's all right, I'm sure it will be,' said Butcher Qian.
属下又想，将来事情了结之后，小郡主总是要放还给他们的。 他们得知郡主娘娘这些日子是住在宫里，也不辱没了她身份，倘若老是关在小号屠宰房的地窖之中，闻那牛血猪血的腥气，未免太对不起人。”	'There's this to be said too, for hiding her here. When this business is over and the Little Countess is back with her own people again, it won't be any disgrace to her if they know that she's been kept all the time in the Palace; whereas if I were to keep her in the basement of my slaughterhouse—well, what with the stink of blood and offal round her all the time, it wouldn't be very nice for a person of her quality.'
韦小宝笑道：“每天喂她吃些茯苓、党参、花雕、鸡蛋，也就是了。”	'Unless you fed her on China-root and gave her Shaoxing wine to drink,' said Trinket mischievously.
钱老板嘿嘿一笑，说道：“再说，小郡主年纪虽然幼小，总是女子，跟我们这些臭男人住在一起，于名声未免有碍，跟韦香主在一起，就不要紧了。”	Butcher Qian laughed at the interruption before continuing: 'Besides, although the Little Countess is only a girl, being a member of the fair sex it wouldn't do much for her good name if she was kept with a lot of rough men; whereas being kept with you, Master, it won't matter.'
韦小宝一怔，问道：“为什么？”	'Why's that?' said Trinket in some surprise.
钱老板道：“韦香主年纪也轻，何况又是…… 又是在宫里办事的，自然…… 自然没什么。”	'Well,' said Butcher Qian, 'you're young too, and besides . . . besides . . . you work in the Palace, so of course ... I mean . . . it's all right.'
言语吞吞吐吐，有些不便出口。 韦小宝见他神色忸怩，想了一想，这才明白：“原来你说我是太监，因此小郡主交我看管，于她声名无碍。	The butcher was clearly embarrassed, and Trinket had to think for some moments before he saw why. 'Oh, I see. You mean because I'm a eunuch. If I'm the one guarding her, it won't do any harm to her reputation.
你可不知我这太监是冒牌货。”	But I'm only a pretend eunuch, you know.'
只因他并不是真的太监，这才要想了一想之后方能明白，否则钱老板第一句话他就懂了。	It was because he wasn't a real eunuch that he hadn't grasped sooner what the embarrassed butcher was getting at.
钱老板问道：“韦香主的卧室在里进罢？”	'Is your bedroom in there, Master?' asked the butcher.
韦小宝点点头。	Trinket nodded.
钱老板俯身抱起小郡主，走到后进，放在床上。	Butcher Qian took up the Little Countess in his arms, carried her into the bedroom, and laid her down on the bed.
房中本来有大床、小床各一，海大富死后，韦小宝已叫人将小床抬了出去。	There was just the one large bed there. Previously there had been a smaller one as well in which Trinket used to sleep, but after the death of Old Hai, he had had it moved out.
他隐秘之事甚多，没要小太监住在屋里服侍。	He had too many secrets to want a young eunuch attendant living with him in his apartment.
钱老板道：“属下带小郡主进宫来时，已点了她背心上的神堂穴、阳纲穴，还点了她后颈的天柱穴，让她不能动弹，说不出话。	'Before I brought her in, I closed the Holy Hall and Yang Cord points on her back and the Pillar of Heaven one on her neck so that she couldn't move or speak,' said the butcher.
韦香主要放她吃饭，就可解开她穴道，不过最好先点她腿上环跳穴，免得她逃跑。	'If you want her to eat anything, you'll have to open them up again; but before you do that, I'd advise you to first close the Ring Jump points on her legs so that she can't run away.
沐王府的人武功甚高，这小姑娘倒不会多少武功，却也不可不防。”	The Mu people are all very skilled in the Martial Arts, and though a young girl like this isn't likely to know much about that sort of thing, it isn't worth taking any chances.'
韦小宝想问他什么叫神堂穴、环跳穴，如何点穴、解穴，但转念一想，自己是青木堂香主，又是总舵主的弟子，连点穴、解穴也不会，岂不是让下属们太也瞧不起？ 反正对付一个小姑娘总不是什么难事，点头道：“知道了。”	Trinket wanted to ask him where the Holy Hall and Ring Jump vital points were and how you closed and opened them; but then he remembered that, as Master of the Green Wood Lodge and a disciple of the great Helmsman, he was probably expected to know about these things and felt sure his subordinates would despise him if they found out that he was totally ignorant of these matters; so he just nodded and said that he would. 'Anyway, ' he thought, 'I shouldn't have any difficulty in handling her. She's only a girl.'
钱老板道：“请韦香主借一把刀使。”	'Could you lend me a knife, Master?' said Butcher Qian.
韦小宝心想：“你要刀干什么？” 从靴桶中取出匕首，递了给他。	Trinket wondered nervously what he wanted it for, but stooped down nevertheless and extracted the dagger from inside his boot.
钱老板接了过来，在猪背上一划，没料到这匕首锋利无匹，割猪肉如切豆腐，一剑下去，直没至柄。	Butcher Qian took it from him and made an incision in the back of the pig's carcass. Unaware of the blade's incomparable sharpness, he was somewhat surprised at the ease with which it sank in, at once burying itself up to the hilt and slicing through fat and flesh as if it were bean curd.
钱老板吃了一惊，赞道：“好剑！”	'This is a good weapon you've got here,' he said admiringly.
割下两片脊肉，两只前腿，道：“韦香主留着烧烤来吃，余下的吩咐小公公们抬回厨房去罢。	In no time at all he had cut off the two forelegs and two large collops from the back. ''You can keep these to roast and eat yourself, Master, ' he said. The rest you can give to the little Goong-goongs to carry back to the kitchens.
属下这就告辞，会里的事情，属下随时来向韦香主禀告。”	I'll take my leave now. If there's any business in the Society to report, I'll let you know straight away, '
韦小宝接过匕首，说道：“好！”	'Right, ' said Trinket.
向卧在床上的小郡主瞧了一眼，道：“这小娘皮睡得倒挺安稳。”	He glanced towards the Little Countess lying on the bed: 'This girl—she's sleeping very soundly.'
他本来想说：“这小姑娘在宫里耽得久了，太过危险，倘若给人发觉，那可糟糕之极。”	He'd wanted to say, 'This girl better not stay here long. It's terribly dangerous having her here. If anyone were to find out, I'd really be in the shit, '
但想天地会的英雄好汉岂有怕危险的？ 这等话说出口来，不免给人小觑了。	But then he reflected that all members of the Triad Society were heroes who laughed at danger and would despise him if they heard him uttering such craven words.
待钱老板回去厨房，韦小宝忙闩上了门，又查看窗户，一无缝隙，这才坐到床边，去看那小郡主，只见她正睁着圆圆的眼睛，望着床顶，见韦小宝过来，忙闭上眼睛。	As soon as Butcher Qian had gone back to the kitchens, Trinket barred the door and checked the window to make sure there were no chinks or slits in the paper through which anyone could peep into the room, then, sitting on the edge of the bed, he inspected the Little Countess. She was staring fixedly at the top of the bedstead, and when she saw Trinket approach, she closed her eyes fast.
韦小宝笑道：“你不会说话，不会动弹，安安静静的躺在这里，最乖不过。”	He laughed. 'You can't talk and you can't move! All you can do is just lie there like a good little girl!'
见她身上衣衫也不污秽，想是钱老板将那口肥猪的肚里洗得十分干净，不留丝毫血渍，于是拉过被来，盖在她身上。	Her dress was still clean, and Trinket reflected that Butcher Qian must have done a good job of cleaning out the inside of the carcass. He threw a coverlet over her.
只见她脸颊雪白，没半分血色，长长的睫毛不住颤动，想是心中十分害怕，笑道：“你不用怕，我不会杀了你的。	From the snowy pallor of her cheeks, drained of all their colour, and the fluttering of her long eyelashes, he could tell that she was very frightened. 'Don't be afraid,' he said. 'I'm not going to kill you.
过得几天，就放你出去。”	Just wait a few days and I'll be setting you free again.'
小郡主睁开眼来，瞧了他一眼，忙又闭上眼睛。	The Little Countess opened her eyes wide, looked at him for a moment, and then quickly closed them again.
韦小宝寻思：“你沐王府在江湖上好大威风，那日苏北道上，你家那白寒松好大架子，丝毫没将老子瞧在眼里，这当儿还不是让我手下的人打死了。 他奶奶的……” 想到此处，伸起手来，见手腕上黑黑一圈乌青兀自未退，隐隐还感疼痛，心道：“那白寒枫死了哥哥，没处出气，捏得老子骨头也险些断了。	Trinket thought of the great awe in which the Mu Family were held by all the Brotherhood of River and Lake; of their stuck-up henchman the elder Bo—now dead, fortunately, struck down by one of his Triads—and his younger brother who had raged at him and nearly broken his wrist. (The bruise was still there, he saw on inspecting it, and only slightly fainter.)
想不到沐王府的郡主娘娘却落在我手里，老子要打便打，要骂便骂，你半分动弹不得，哈哈，哈哈！”	'And now their Little Countess is in my hands,' he thought. 'I can beat her and curse her as much as I want to, and she won't be able to move a muscle.'
