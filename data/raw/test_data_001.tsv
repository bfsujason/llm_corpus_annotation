北风如刀，满地冰霜。	
江南近海滨的一条大路上，一队清兵手执刀枪，押着七辆囚车，冲风冒寒，向北而行。	Along a coastal road somewhere south of the Yangtze River, a detachment of soldiers, each of them armed with a halberd, was escorting a line of seven prison carts, trudging northwards in the teeth of a bitter wind.
前面三辆囚车中分别监禁的是三个男子，都作书生打扮，一个是白发老者，两个是中年人。	In each of the first three carts a single male prisoner was caged, identifiable by his dress as a member of the scholar class. One was a white-haired old man. The other two were men of middle years.
后面四辆囚车中坐的是女子，最后一辆囚车中是个少妇，怀中抱着个女婴。	The four rear carts were occupied by women, the last of them by a young mother holding a baby girl at her breast.
女婴啼哭不休。 她母亲温言相呵，女婴只是大哭。	The little girl was crying in a continuous wail which her mother's gentle words of comfort were powerless to console.
囚车旁一清兵恼了，伸腿在车上踢了一脚，喝道：“再哭，再哭！	One of the soldiers marching alongside, irritated by the baby's crying, aimed a mighty kick at the cart. 'Stop it! Shut up!
老子踢死你！”	Or I'll really give you something to cry about!'
那女婴一惊，哭得更加响了。	The baby, startled by this sudden violence, cried even louder.
离开道路数十丈处有座大屋，屋檐下站着一个中年文士，一个十一二岁的小孩。	Under the eaves of a large house, some hundred yards from the road, a middle-aged scholar was standing with a ten- or eleven-year-old boy at his side.
那文士见到这等情景，不禁长叹一声，眼眶也红了，说道：“可怜，可怜！”	He was evidently affected by this little scene, for a groan escaped his lips and he appeared to be very close to tears. 'Poor creatures!' he murmured to himself.
那小孩问道：“爹爹，他们犯了什么罪？”	'Papa,' said the little boy, 'what have they done wrong?'
那文士道：“又犯了什么罪？	'What indeed!' said the man, bitterly.
昨日和今朝已逮去了三十几人，都是我们浙江有名的读书人，个个都是无辜株连。” 他说到“无辜株连”四子，声音压得甚低，生怕给押囚车的官兵听见了。	'During these last two days they must have made more than thirty arrests. All our best scholars. And all of them innocents, caught up in the net,' he added in an undertone, for fear that the soldiers might hear him.
那小孩道：“那个小女孩还在吃奶，难道也犯了罪么？	That girl's only a baby,' said the boy. 'What can she possibly be guilty of?
真没道理。”	It's very wrong.'
那文士道：“你懂得官兵没道理，真是好孩子。	'So you understand that what the Government soldiers do is wrong,' said the man. 'Good for you, my son!'
哎，人为刀俎，我为鱼肉，人为鼎镬，我为麋鹿！”	He sighed. 'They are the cleaver and we are the meat. They are the cauldron and we are the deer.'
那小孩道：“爹，你前几天教过我， ‘人为刀俎，我为鱼肉’，就是给人家斩割屠杀的意思。	'You explained "they are the cleaver and we are the meat" the other day, papa,' said the boy. 'It's what they say when people are massacred or beheaded.
人家是切菜刀，是砧板，我们就是鱼和肉。	Like meat or fish being sliced up on the chopping-board.
“人为鼎镬，我为麋鹿”这两句话，意思也差不多么？”	Does "they are the cauldron and we are the deer" mean the same thing?'
那文士道：“正是！” 眼见官兵和囚车已经去远，拉着小孩的手道：“外面风大，我们回屋里去。”	'Yes, more or less,' said the man; and since the train of soldiers and prison carts was now fast receding, he took the boy by the hand. 'Let's go indoors now,' he said. 'It's too windy for standing outside.'
当下父子二人走进书房。	Indoors the two of them went, and into his study.
那文士提笔蘸上了墨，在纸上写了个“鹿”字，说道：“鹿这种野兽，虽是庞然大物，性子却极为平和，只吃青草和树叶，从来不伤害别的野兽。	The man picked up a writing-brush and moistened it on the ink-slab, then, on a sheet of paper, he wrote the character for a deer. 'The deer is a wild animal, but although it is comparatively large, it has a very peaceable nature. It eats only grass and leaves and never harms other animals.
凶猛的野兽要伤它吃它，它只有逃跑，倘若逃不了，那只有给人家吃了。”	So when other animals want to hurt it or to eat it, all it can do is run away. If it can't escape by running away, it gets eaten.'
又写了“逐鹿”两字，说道：“因此古人常常拿鹿来比喻天下。	He wrote the characters for 'chasing the deer' on the sheet of paper. 'That's why in ancient times they often used the deer as a symbol of Empire.
世上百姓都温顺善良，只有给人欺压残害的份儿。	The common people, who are the subjects of Empire, are gentle and obedient. Like the deer's, it is their lot to be cruelly treated and oppressed.
《汉书》上说：‘秦失其鹿，天下共逐之。’	In the History of the Han Dynasty it says "Qin lost the deer and the world went chasing after it".
那就是说，秦朝失了天下，群雄并起，大家争夺，最后汉高祖打败了楚霸王，就得了这只又肥又大的鹿。”	That means that when the Qin Emperor lost control of the Empire, ambitious men rose up everywhere and fought each other to possess it. In the end it was the first Han Emperor who got this big, fat deer by defeating the Tyrant King of Chu.'
那小孩点头道：“我明白了。	'I know,' said the boy.
小说书上说‘逐鹿中原’，就是大家争着要作皇帝的意思。”	'In my story-books it says "they chased the deer on the Central Plain". That means they were all fighting each other to become Emperor.'
那文士甚是喜欢，点了点头，在纸上画了一只鼎的图形，道：“古人煮食，不用灶头锅子，用这样三只脚的鼎，下面烧柴，捉到了鹿，就在鼎里煮来吃。	The scholar nodded, pleased with his young son's astuteness. He drew a picture of a cauldron on the sheet of paper. 'In olden times they didn't use a cooking-pot on the stove to cook their food in, they used a three-legged cauldron like this and lit a fire underneath it. When they caught a deer they put it in a cauldron to seethe it.
皇帝和大官都很残忍，心里不喜欢谁，就说他犯了罪，把他放在鼎里活活煮熟。	Those ancient Emperors and great ministers were very cruel. If they didn't like somebody, they would pretend that they had committed some crime or other, and then they would put them in a cauldron and boil them.
《史记》中记载蔺相如对秦王说：‘臣知欺大王之罪当诛也，臣请就鼎锅。’	In the Records of an Historian Lin Xiangru says to the King of Qin, "Deceiving Your Majesty was a capital offence. I beg to approach the cauldron."
就是说：‘我该死，将我在鼎里烧死了罢！’”	What he meant was, "I deserve to die. Put me in the cauldron and boil me."'
那小孩道：“小说书上又常说‘问鼎中原’，这跟‘逐鹿中原’好像意思差不多。”	'Often in my story-books I've seen the words "asking about the cauldrons in the Central Plain",' said the boy. 'It seems to mean the same thing as "chasing the deer in the Central Plain".'
那文士道：“不错。	'It does,' said the man.
夏禹王收九州之金，铸了九大鼎。	'King Yu of the Xia dynasty, the first dynasty that ever was, collected metal from all the nine provinces of the Empire and used it to cast nine great cauldrons with.
当时所谓的“金”其实是铜。	"Metal" in those days meant bronze.
每一口鼎上铸了九州的名字和山川图形，后世为天下之主的，便保有九鼎。	Each of these bronze cauldrons had the name of one of the nine provinces on it and a map showing the mountains and rivers of that province. In later times whoever became master of the Empire automatically became the guardian of these cauldrons.
《左传》上说：‘楚子观兵于周疆。 定王使王孙满劳楚子。 楚子问鼎之大小轻重焉。’	In The Chronicle of Zuo it says that when the Viscount of Chu was reviewing his troops on Zhou territory and the Zhou king sent Prince Man to him with his royal compliments, the Viscount questioned Prince Man about the size and weight of the cauldrons.
只有天下之主，方能保有九鼎。	Of course, as ruler of the whole Empire, only the Zhou king had the right to be guardian of the cauldrons.
楚子只是楚国的诸侯，他问鼎的轻重大小，便是心存不轨，想取周王之位而代之。”	For a mere Viscount like the ruler of Chu to ask questions about them showed that he was planning to seize the Empire for himself.'
那小孩道：“所以‘问鼎’、‘逐鹿’便是想做皇帝。	'So "asking about the cauldrons" and "chasing the deer" both mean wanting to be Emperor, ' said the boy.
‘未知鹿死谁手’，就是不知哪一个做成了皇帝。”	'And "not knowing who will kill the deer" means not knowing who is going to be Emperor.'
那文士道：“正是。	'That's right,' said the man.
到得后来，‘问鼎’、‘逐鹿’，这四个字，也可借用于别处，但原来的出典，是专指做皇帝而言。”	'As time went by these expressions came to be applied to other situations as well, but originally they were only used in the sense of wanting to be Emperor.'
说到这里，叹了口气，道：“咱们做百姓的，总是死路一条。	He sighed. 'For the common people though, the subjects of Empire, our role is to be the deer.
‘未知鹿死谁手’，只不过未知是谁来杀了这头鹿，这头鹿，却是死定了的。”	It may be uncertain who will kill the deer, but the deer gets killed all right. There's no uncertainty about that.'
他说着走到窗边，向窗外望去， 只见天色沉沉的，似要下雪，叹道：“老天爷何其不仁，数百个无辜之人，在这冰霜遍地的道上行走。	He walked over to the window and gazed outside. The sky had now turned a leaden hue showing that snow was on its way. He sighed again, 'He must be a cruel God up there. Those hundreds of poor, innocent souls on the roads in this freezing weather.
下起雪来，可又多受一番折磨了。”	The snow will only add to their sufferings.'
